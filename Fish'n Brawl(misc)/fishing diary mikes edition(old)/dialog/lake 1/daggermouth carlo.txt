daggermouth carlo will be at the 2nd lakes park.

	your first encounter with daggermouth carlo takes place near the lakes shore.  he is fishing and jigging hard.  (note that he is jigging hard.)  carlo is an sly gutman tempered cutthroat kind of guy.  he is quite cunning in his remarks as if he has some sort of tuff output in regards to his fighting contour.

	the second encounter involving carlo actually involves himself approaching the player of games character.   carlo sneaks behind the character as you enter a certain field of map/view.  he says something sly such as to show why they call him daggermouth.  [such as displayed below in the dialog textuals below.]
	the fight against carlo involves him having some sort of weapon.  probly a dagger. or a sword LOL.  I'm thinking we can allow some sort of (pause game incites, such as dialog or some animations)  daggermouth carlo will then say things such as (Im going to GUT YOU,,,, or You want the Edge of my blade!!...)  it will be great if we could add such things.  as well as the other characters with active emotes or such would be great.
