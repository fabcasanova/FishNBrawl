game goes into fishing mode, as your player takes a rod that jim let's you borrow, equipped with nightcrawlers, but also jim gives you dough balls as a alternative.  

so there will be on screen 'tips' as to guide you in a tutorial motive in learning how to simply fish in the game.

during the tutorial when you are fishing.  and jim will say a couple words as your pressing buttons as such

||enter button guidance entry||

Jim is going to say: 

when you jig it-- hey now!
when you reel in slow or mixed tempo -- there we go!
when you get a strike -- woah whee!
when you reel in the fish -- ohhh yeeah
when you catch the fish final -- woah whee!

jim now says after you catch a fish,  --<<<??CBVV
Now here we go now, time to go out onwards towards the other parts of the lake.
here take my rod, and get some practice...  you can use some of my gear till you catch a few wangers.. ''should be able to make some change' from what your hauling.
Get yourself some decent gear and maybe you'll have a chance at taking the lead in the lake jereder fish or no fish the dang doozle event.
