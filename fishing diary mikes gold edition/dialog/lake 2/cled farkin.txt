cled farkin will be located at lake jerudur.

Cled farkin's story will begin in [this frame of the game].  He will be seen possibly on a bench or table of sort, and what he will be doing is such as toying around his fishing gear.  


	His fishing gear will be consorted by the graphic artist (fabian).  He can add what he feels is neccessary for doings.  As fabian is a fisher as well.  maybe cled farken will have tackle box and one fishing pole, (to represent that he is just noob fisher.)  But possibly he could also have a fishing net/stickhandle, with him that would be hillarious.  

He will be figiting around with a string from the pole trying to tie a knot.  

-to make it conjure laughter 
>>we could have him maybe keep hitting his head while trying to tie a knot with the palm of his hand. 
>>we could have a dialog box near him that pops up showing frustrated talking to himself like so (darn it!, farking!, whoops!, almost got it that time!.  maybe even roll these sayings in a random series.  so the viewing has a wider perception of cled's personality.
