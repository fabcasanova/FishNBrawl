# FishNBrawl


#This game is a beat em up platformer.  You play as fisherman Brutus, who is competing in a bass fishing tournament.  The player has to catch a high weight limit while 
 battling npcs.
 
  -First Level is the only level that is built.  The sprite is loaded and can walk around first platform of the level.  There are no boundarie or npcs in the level currently.
  -Game is on hiatus due to other projects that I'm working on.  Feel free to browse files.
  
# This game is built off of the engine from the chenko tutorials.  This game is only used for educational purposes.
